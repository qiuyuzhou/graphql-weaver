 * A weak map with arrays of weakly-referenced objects as key

 * Performance consideration: values are bucketed into the *one element* of the respective key (by default, the first
 * array element). Inside this bucket, a linear search is performed for the correct key. This works fine as long as one
 * element of the key is already very decisive.
 *
 * A key is weakly referenced as soon as there are no entries which contain any element of that key. Again, this is only
 * practical if keys are mostly clustered.
